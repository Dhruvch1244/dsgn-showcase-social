         * the accent *is* a two-colour gradient and that the hero CTA carries

         * `--glow-accent`, which is itself composed from both ends of the
         * pair and so follows an accent-preset swap for free.
         *
         * Both ends were checked against `--accent-foreground`: the tightest
         * pairing across the three presets is aurora's violet end at 5.2:1,
         * which still clears AA for the label. Edited here rather than passed
         * as a className at each call site because there are four
         * `variant="glow"` CTAs in this app and they must not drift apart.
